Transport Tycoon Exercises for DDD solution (https://github.com/Softwarepark/exercises/blob/master/transport-tycoon.md)

The idea to make use of this approach was brought from Smalltalk "Bluebook"
(http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/64) -- event-driven simulations. Sorry me for my PEP8!
I violated it intentionally for the sake of respect of this great language.

First usecase (Exercise 1)

A -> 5 hours
AB -> 5 hours
BB -> 5 hours
ABB -> 7 hours
AABABBAB - > 29 hours
ABBBABAAABBB -> 41 hours

Second usecase (Exercise 2)

ABBBABAAABBB -> 39 hours

See ./traces directory to investigate domain events.

How to build/run:
